<h2>An Application Programming Interface (API) for car reservation is a set of protocols and tools that allow developers to integrate car rental services into their applications. This API typically provides a standardized interface for booking, modifying, and canceling car reservations, as well as retrieving data about available cars<h2/>


<h3>Technologies used</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Typescript</li>
  <li>Node.JS</li>
  <li>Express</li>
  <li>MongoDB</li>
  <li>Mongoose</li>
  <li>Swagger</li>
</ul> 

<h1>Installing Node.js on the project</h1>
<h3>Step 1:</h3>
<p>Run the following command:</p>
<code>npm install</code>
<p>To set up the TypeScript Compiler (tsc) in a TypeScript API, you need to follow these steps:

Install TypeScript: Make sure you have TypeScript installed globally on your system. You can install it using the following command: <code>npm install -g typescript</code>.

Initialize the TypeScript project: Create a new directory for your project and run the command <code>npm init -y</code> to create a basic package.json file. Then, create a TypeScript configuration file by running the command <code>tsc --init</code>.

Configure the tsconfig.json file: This file contains the TypeScript settings for your project. You can customize the settings to meet your specific needs. Some of the important settings that you may need to adjust include:

target: Defines the version of ECMAScript for which TypeScript will compile your code.

module: Defines the module format that will be generated by TypeScript.

outDir: Defines the output directory where the JavaScript files will be generated.

rootDir: Defines the input directory where the TypeScript files are located.

Create the project structure: Create the necessary directories and files for your TypeScript API. It is important that the TypeScript files are in the input directory defined in the tsconfig.json configuration.

Compile the TypeScript code: Run the tsc command in the terminal to compile your TypeScript code. tsc will look for the tsconfig.json file and compile the code according to the settings defined in it. The JavaScript files will be generated in the output directory defined in the tsconfig.json configuration.

Run the API: To run the API, you need to start the HTTP server in your JavaScript code generated by TypeScript. This can be done with the help of a dependency management package such as npm.

I hope this information helps you set up the TypeScript Compiler in your TypeScript API. Good luck!<p>
